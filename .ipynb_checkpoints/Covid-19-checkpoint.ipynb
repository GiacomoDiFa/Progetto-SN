    "## The SEIR model in brief\n",
    "\n",
    "In a population there are several groups of individuals, characterized by four numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "* Susceptibles $S$: number of individuals which can be infected\n",
    "* Exposed $E$: number of individuals which have been infected but are not yet infectious\n",
    "* Infectious $I$: number of individuals which are infectious\n",
    "* Recovered $R$: number of individuals who have been infected and have recovered, acquiring (we hope) an immunity as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "All these quantities are a function of time, which in the following is measured in day.\n",
    "We will call $N(t) = S(t) + E(t) + I(t) + R(t)$ the total number of individuals in the population as a function of time $t$; in the model this number is not constant, and its initial value is $N(0) = N_0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, we introduce several parameters\n",
    "* The natural death rate $\\mu$, namely the fraction of population dying each day: it is assumed equal to the birth rate, to keep the population stable.\n",
    "* The force of the infection $\\beta$: it is related to the probability that a susceptible person, coming in contact with an infected person, gets exposed actually.\n",
    "* The delay from exposition to becoming infectious $\\epsilon$: it is related to the time needed by an exposed person to become infectious.\n",
    "* The rate of recovery $\\gamma$: the inverse of the duration of an illness. We will assume that an infected person is contagious during the whole of his/her illness.\n",
    "\n",
    "All these assumptions allow to model the evolution of the different components of the population; for the susceptible individuals one has\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\frac{d S}{d t} = \\mu (N - S) - \\beta \\frac{I\\cdot S}{N}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "where the first term is the balance between births and natural deaths, the second term is the number of people being exposed per day; remember that $N$ is not constant, $N(t) = S(t) + E(t) + I(t) + R(t)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The exposed individuals change in time as\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\frac{d E}{d t} = \\beta \\frac{I\\cdot S}{N} - (\\mu + \\epsilon) E\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "in which the first is a growth term due to infections, the second is a depletion term due to people dying naturally or becoming infectious.\n",
    "\n",
    "In turn the infectious individuals change as\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\frac{d I}{d t} = \\epsilon E - (\\gamma + \\mu + \\alpha) I\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "in which the first term is the number of exposed becoming infectious per unit time, the second term models the reduction in the number of infectious individuals, because they recover ($\\gamma$ term) or die for natural or Covid-19 related causes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally for the recovered individuals we have\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\frac{d R}{d t} = \\gamma I - \\mu R\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "These equations are nonlinear because of the $\\beta \\frac{I\\cdot S}{N}$ term, and we have therefore to integrate them numerically.\n",

    "\\begin{equation}\n",

    "\n",
    "These values are very uncertain and should not be taken seriously beyond the scope of the exercise. In particular, the fatality rate depends strongly on the quality of the cures received, and if the health system gets overwhelmed it increases significantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "An important derived parameter is the basic reproduction number ${\\cal R}_0$ which represents the average number of new infections due to an infected individual, during his/her illness, assuming the whole population is susceptible: it is therefore given by\n",

    "\n",
    "With the assumed parameters, the basic reproduction number is therefore ${\\cal R}_0 \\simeq 3.4$, similar to what is observed at the peak of infection in Lombardy.\n",
    "\n",
    "To control the infection, a government can reduce the parameter $\\beta$ by imposing a lockdown, as Italy did early in March.\n",
    "\n",
